# utility-bill-tracker

Please center this code in html, javascript and css aelectric utility billings auditor, that can analyze and track electric  and gas usage over the past year. This could be a valuable tool for individuals and businesses to monitor their utility costs and identify potential areas for savings.

To begin, we would need to gather and integrate historical utility bill data from the past 12 months. This data would include details such as billing period, usage in kWh for electricity and therms for gas.

Next, we would develop algorithms to analyze this data and identify patterns or anomalies in utility usage and costs. This could involve comparing usage trends month-over-month, identifying peak usage periods, and detecting any sudden spikes in consumption that may indicate inefficiencies or issues.

Additionally, we could incorporate machine learning models to predict future utility costs based on historical data, helping users anticipate and budget for upcoming bills more accurately.

Furthermore, we could add features such as customizable alerts for unusual usage patterns, recommendations for energy-saving measures, and cost-saving tips based on the analysis of the data.

the user will manually enter the past 12 months billing in the proper column ,their name, account number, address, city, state and zip code. The auditor will anaylzed the billing and check for errors and print out a report. create a column named Start Gas Meter Read Date 1, create column named total therms used.
Oldest bill first followed by a 12 rows from January to December to enter bill data, create a column named kWh usage, create column named total kWh monthly cost.
code in html, javascript and css an app  designed to help users audit their gas and electricity utilities to ensure they are being billed accurately, identify areas of inefficiency, and provide recommendations for cost savings. The key features should include:

Utility bill analysis: The app should be able to analyze user-provided utility bills, including gas and electricity bills. It should extract relevant information such as usage, rates, and charges, and compare them with historical data and industry standards to identify any discrepancies or inefficiencies.
Usage tracking: The app should allow users to track their gas and electricity usage over time, enabling them to monitor changes and identify trends. This can be achieved by integrating with smart home devices or by providing a simple interface for users to manually input their meter readings.
Energy efficiency recommendations: Based on the user's usage patterns and other relevant data, the app should provide personalized recommendations for improving energy efficiency. This could include suggestions for upgrading appliances, optimizing heating and cooling settings, or implementing energy-saving habits.
Billing error detection: The app should be capable of detecting common billing errors, such as incorrect meter readings, incorrect rate calculations, or unauthorized charges. It should alert users when such errors are detected and provide guidance on how to rectify them.
Savings estimation: The app should estimate potential savings based on the user's current usage, billing, and recommended energy efficiency improvements. This can help users understand the financial benefits of implementing the suggested changes.
User-friendly interface: The app should have an intuitive and user-friendly interface that makes it easy for users to input their data, navigate through different features, and understand the provided insights and recommendations.
Step 2: Data collection and analysis
The app should be built on a robust data collection and analysis framework. To achieve this, consider the following:

Data sources: The app should be able to collect data from various sources, including user-provided utility bills, smart home devices, and public databases on industry standards and regulations.
Data preprocessing: Develop a system to clean, normalize, and preprocess the collected data to ensure consistency and accuracy.
Machine learning models: Leverage machine learning techniques to analyze the collected data and identify patterns, trends, and anomalies. This can include using regression models for usage prediction, clustering algorithms for user segmentation, and anomaly detection methods for identifying billing errors.
Benchmarking: Establish industry benchmarks for energy usage and billing rates to compare against user data. This will help identify areas of inefficiency and potential savings opportunities.
Step 3: Implementation and deployment
Once the app's purpose, features, and data analysis framework have been defined, the next step is to implement and deploy the app. Consider the following:

Development platform: Choose a suitable platform for app development, such as Android, iOS, or a web-based platform.
API integration: Integrate with relevant APIs, such as those provided by smart home device manufacturers or utility companies, to enable seamless data collection and analysis.
User interface design: Develop a user-friendly interface that makes it easy for users to input their data, navigate through different features, and understand the provided insights and recommendations.
Security and privacy: Ensure that user data is securely stored and processed, and that the app complies with relevant data protection regulations.
Testing and validation: Thoroughly test the app to ensure it is accurate, reliable, and user-friendly. Validate the app's performance using real-world data and user feedback.
Continuous improvement: Regularly update the app with new features, improvements, and bug fixes based on user feedback and emerging trends in the energy industry.
